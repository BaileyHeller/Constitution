# Roosevelt High School Robotics Club Constitution
Seattle, Washington

## Article 1: Name

This club will be referred to as The Roosevelt Robotics Club, or The Iron Riders.

## Article 2: Purpose

This club's purpose is to include students interested in participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition, the FIRST Tech Challenge, in the construction of complex robots, advanced mechanics, competition strategy,  software programming, or any students interested in recruiting corporate sponsors, advertising/marketing, or business management. The goals of The Iron Riders are:

* To compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition and FIRST Tech Challenge.

* To encourage leadership, engineering, programming, and high ethical standards respected in the business, engineering, and programming worlds.
* To promote understanding and appreciation of science and technology.
* To fundraise, gather sponsors, and provide recognition for local businesses through our business team.
* To promote social development between different ages, genders, cultures, groups, communities, and people through the Robotics Club, the FIRST organization, and our group activities from meetings, events, FIRST Competitions, etc.
* To represent Roosevelt High School well and leave a respectable image as representatives of our school.
* To uphold the values of the FIRST organization.

## Article 3: Organization

A student leadership team will govern the Roosevelt Robotics club with the advice and consent of the faculty advisors. The student leadership team is outlined in Articles 4 and 11. Each member of the leadership team must be in good standing as a FIRST member for the current FIRST season.

## Article 4: Officers

The club will consist of one President, a Vice President, a Project Manager, Hardware Lead, Software Lead, Business Lead, Design Lead, Strategy Lead, and a Safety Captain. They communicate and organize meetings. 

These officers are responsible for organizing meetings and creating agendas for each meeting. Each officer will have meeting responsibilities divvied up in the by-laws. Each officer is expected to be present in a majority of the club's strategy and direction meetings. 

The current officers announce the election two weeks prior to the election day. Candidates announce their candidacy no later than one week prior to the election by submitting a written statement and speech. Officers are elected by running for the position and receiving a majority of votes from members who are voting, if there is competition for the position. Any uncontested position will be filled by volunteering. Elections will be held after the end of the build season but before the end of the school year. A meeting will be held for the candidates to present their positions, and voting will proceed at the next club meeting. In person attendance is required to vote. A candidate need not be present at the meeting to run, but must have submitted a written position when they declared their candidacy.

Each Robotics Club Member will maintain their position for the entirety of the year. All officers must be actively involved in FIRST Robotics and be in good ethical standing. Each officer has the opportunity to be re-elected for the next FIRST season.

A Robotics Club officer is expected to meet the responsibilities associated with their position, and, if unable, they may choose to step down. An emergency election is held and a new candidate is elected within one month of the officer stepping down. If an officer leaves leadership between general elections, they cannot become a lead again until the next general election.

If the officer continues to not meet the expectations associated with their position and chooses not to step down, a challenge to the position may occur. In a challenge, a Robotics club member runs in a challenge election against the current officer. If a simple majority (over 50%) of club leadership vote for the challenging candidate, the current Officer is removed from office and the challenger takes his/her position.

## Article 5: Meetings

Meetings will be held every day for work on the FIRST Robots after the club kickoff in September, with larger strategy and direction meetings on Wednesdays. Leadership meetings will be held on Tuesdays for a maximum of 1 hour. All meetings will happen in room 217 unless otherwise noted. A meeting agenda will be posted to the forums at least 48 hours in advance and a summary will be posted within 24 hours afterwards. Both of these jobs will be done by the President, Vice President, or otherwise delegated.

## Article 6: Advisor(s)

The Roosevelt Robotics Club's advisors shall be Mr. K Ruff (Engineering and Technology), Mr. J Miller (Math), and Ms. A Myers (Computer Science).

## Article 7: Finances

The Roosevelt Robotics Club is responsible for its finances, organizing the cost of activities, recruiting sponsors, acquiring donations, and managing the club bank account.

## Article 8: Amendments

To make any amendments to this constitution, a written proposal must be presented to the current President and Advisor of the Roosevelt Robotics Club. Amendments can be presented by any club member. A decision will be made by the President and Leadership as to whether to present the amendment to the entire club. A simple leadership majority ratifies the amendment.

## Article 9: Ratification

The signatures of a majority of The Leadership and the club advisors shall ratify this constitution.
